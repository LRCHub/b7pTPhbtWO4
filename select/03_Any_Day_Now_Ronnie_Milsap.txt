Any day now
I will hear you say,good bye, my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Any day now, I'll be all alone
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh

Any day now
When your restless eyes meets someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise, then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life

Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now
When the clock strikes go, you'll call it off.
Then my tears will flow
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Any day now
Love will let me down
'Cause you won't be around

INSTRUMENTAL

Then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down,'ause you won't be around
Any day now, you won't be around
Ooh,ooh,ooh
No, no, no, no, no, no, you won't be around
