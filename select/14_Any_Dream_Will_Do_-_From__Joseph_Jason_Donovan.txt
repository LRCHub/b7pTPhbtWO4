I closed my eyes,
Drew back the curtain,
To see for certain,
What I thought I knew.
Far, far away
Someone was weeping,
But the world was sleeping,
Any dream will do

I wore my coat
(I wore my coat)
With golden lining,
(Ahah)
Bright colours shining,
(Ahah)
Wonderful and new,

And in the east,
(And in the east)
The dawn was breaking,
(Ahah)
And the world was waking,
(Ahah)
Any dream will do.

A crash of drums,
A flash of light,
My golden coat,
Flew out of sight,
Colours faded into darkness,
I was left alone.

May I return,
(May I return)
To the beginning,
(Ahah)
The light is dimming,
(Ahah)
And the dream is too.

The world and I,
(The world and i)
We are still waiting,
(Ahah)
Still hesitating,
(Ahah)
Any dream will do.

Any dream will do

A crash of drums,
A flash of light,
My golden coat,
Flew out of sight,
Colours faded into darkness,
I was left alone.

May I return,
(May I return)
To the beginning,
(Ahah)
The light is dimming,
(Ahah)
And the dream is too.
The world and I,
(The world and i)
We are still waiting,
(Ahah)
Still hesitating,
(Ahah)
Any dream will do
Any dream will do
Any dream will do
Any dream will do
